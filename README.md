### Project Report: Car Wash Service Management System

---

#### Project Overview

The Car Wash Service Management System is a web-based application designed to optimize the operations of car wash businesses. The system enables users to manage services offered by the car wash, including adding, updating, deleting, and listing services. It incorporates a client-facing interface, backend APIs, and a MySQL database for data storage.

The system also includes automated testing to ensure reliability and robustness during development and deployment.

#### Objectives
- To streamline car wash operations and service management.
- To provide an intuitive interface for managing services.
- To implement a secure and scalable backend with robust database integration.
- To ensure high-quality code through automated testing.

#### Features
1. Service Management:
   - Add, edit, delete, and list car wash services.
   - Services include attributes such as name, description, and price.

2. Image Carousel:
   - A visual carousel displays images showcasing car wash operations.

3. Backend APIs:
   - RESTful APIs built using **Node.js** and **Express.js**.
   - Database integration with MySQL.

4. Frontend:
   - A responsive web interface developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

5. Automated Testing:
   - Integration and unit tests implemented using **Jest** and **Supertest**.

6. Error Handling:
   - Graceful handling of database errors and API failures.
   - User-friendly notifications for missing fields or invalid input.

#### System Architecture
1. Frontend:
   - A single-page interface with input fields for managing services.
   - A navigation bar and image carousel for improved user experience.

2. Backend:
   - APIs for managing services (`/services` endpoint).
   - Handlers for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

3. Database:
   - A MySQL database with a table `services` to store service data:
     - `id` (Primary Key, Auto-increment)
     - `name` (VARCHAR)
     - `description` (TEXT)
     - `price` (DECIMAL).

### CRUD Operations

CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are fundamental operations for interacting with databases in web applications. Below is a summary of each of these operations:

1. Create:
   - The Create operation allows for adding new records to a database. In a typical web application, this is performed via a POST request, where the client sends the required data (like name, description, and price for a service) to be inserted into the database.
   - This operation ensures that new data is stored and available for retrieval or manipulation.

2. Read:
   - The Read operation involves fetching or retrieving data from the database. This operation is often executed through GET requests, where the server responds with the requested data. 
   - In the context of services, a GET request would fetch a list of services or a specific service based on criteria (such as service ID). This is critical for displaying information to users or for further processing.

3. Update:
   - The Update operation modifies existing data in the database. It is executed through PUT or PATCH requests, where the client sends updated data to replace or modify the existing record.
   - This operation is important for making changes to data that might have changed over time, such as updating a service's details or price.

4. Delete:
   - The Delete operation removes records from the database. It is triggered by a DELETE request, where a specific record (identified by an ID) is deleted from the database.
   - This operation is crucial for maintaining the accuracy and relevancy of the data, allowing the removal of outdated or unnecessary records.

#### Automated Testing
1. Integration Tests:
   - Validate API endpoints for CRUD operations using Supertest.
   - Simulate API calls to ensure expected responses.
   - Example: Testing `POST /services` to add a new service.

2. Unit Tests:
   - Mock database interactions using Jest.
   - Ensure isolated testing of core functions like database queries and error handling.

#### Challenges and Solutions
- Database Errors: Handled using robust error-catching mechanisms in the backend.
- UI Responsiveness: Achieved through a mobile-first design for better usability.
- Testing Mock Databases: Used Jest to simulate database connections and query behaviors.
